intro: Industry leader dBs Music have created a state-of-the-art recording, production and performance facility directly on our Camborne campus. The building now houses industry standard studios, rehearsal spaces, IT Suites, dedicated DJ pods and a surround sound lecture theatre. If you are crazy about music and sound and have a real passion to be working in this industry then you will love what dBs Music is all about. At dBs Music we give a true flavor of the music industry and provide you with an environment that will inspire, challenge and excite the music professional in you. Whilst we provide our students with the necessary theoretical foundation they need to support their vocational practice, it is our belief that students should spend most of their time honing their music production craft and getting practical experience on the very best industry standard equipment.
