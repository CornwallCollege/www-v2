intro: Bristol has long been known for its vibrant and eclectic music scene and has a long list of artists all hailing from the city. Massive Attack, Roni Size and Portishead to name a few. We opened our purpose-built FE facilities in late 2012 in Bristolâ€™s thriving Temple Enterprise Zone, a hub for creative types of all disciplines.
