alumni-text: I wanted to get my fitness and confidence up, and this course seemed like the ideal course. The course prepared me for              selection and I got the A grade I needed to get into the Military Police.

student-text1: "I was waiting for basic training and the motivation the Uniformed Services (Military Academy) Diploma gave me was a lot more than I could do myself. I've been pushed further physically and mentally than I ever thought possible. We do military preparation with an acting sergeant plus kayaking, rock climbing, abseiling: things I'd never have done outside of this course. Our tutor was in the forces for over 20 years, the acting sergeant is still serving and the people who come in and assess us are all serving military personnel, a massive bonus over other courses."

student-text3: "I want to be a Police officer and the Public Services (Uniformed) Extended Diploma is a good course for me. The physical side is good, we do a lot of fitness and practical work that will give me a good level of skills to pass the entry requirements for the police force. The location here is good, we're in a nice part of the country, lovely views, basically it's in the middle of nowhere so you can go off and be quiet to do your work. It's really good."
