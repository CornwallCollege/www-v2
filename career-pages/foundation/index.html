student-text1: I'm studying horticulture here at Duchy College. I want to work in horticulture, I'd love to work in a big garden centre and I reckon this courses is helping me do that. I like the views and the scenery here and the poly tunnels are great and I enjoy being here. The best bit has got to be the planting and watching the little tiny seed grow to a massive plant.
