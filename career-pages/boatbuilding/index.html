student-text1: The apprenticeship offers the best chance of decent wages while you learn. I really enjoy working at Duchy Hydraulics. I'm always paired with an experienced employee so I can learn from them. Attending college one day a week breaks up my working days and allows me to gain a qualification and wider marine engineering skills through the various projects we work on.
