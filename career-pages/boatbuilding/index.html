staff-text: Simon is a Falmouth Marine School alumni and has worked with a range of boatyards in the construction of yachts and                 small craft. He supervises both the wood and composite workshops at Falmouth Marine School’s boatbuilding training                 centre in Ponsharden boatyard, helping learners on a day-today basis with developing their practical skills, techniques             and project planning. He also acts as a consultant with the College’s Marine Innovation Service, assisting local                   businesses who wish to develop their processes and products in composite boat manufacturing (FRP).

student-text1: The apprenticeship offers the best chance of decent wages while you learn. I really enjoy working at Duchy                          Hydraulics. I'm always paired with an experienced employee so I can learn from them. Attending college one day a                    week breaks up my working days and allows me to gain a qualification and wider marine engineering skills through the                various projects we work on.

student-text2: Through doing the yacht fit out and composites I got to work with the National Maritime Museum Cornwall restoring                  their historical boat collection, further developing the skills I gained on my course. The workshops are great and                  the tutors are really approachable.
