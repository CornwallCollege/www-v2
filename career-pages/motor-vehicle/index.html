student-text2: The IMI Motor Vehicle course was recommended to me by a friend and I have really enjoyed it. I have made some great                  new friends and learnt a lot. We study all aspects of both the theory and practical side of vehicle maintenance. The                facilities are excellent and are like a real working garage. I am hoping to progress onto University next year.
