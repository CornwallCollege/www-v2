student-text2: Every job is linked with business so it is a key course, and business has a lot of general uses in work. I love the                Business Extended Diploma, the tutors are really helpful and always have the time to work with us. I'm also studying                an accountancy qualification (AAT) alongisde the course, that's the career route I want to take when I finish                      college.

student-text3: Cornwall College is the only place to study with the Peter Jones Enterprise Academy in Cornwall, it's a really                      professional environment, we attend college everyday 9-5 and have to wear smart business dress at all times. When I                finish the level 2 course I want to study further and start my own aquatics business. I'm also planning to use the                  skills I've learnt on this course to organise my own charity Iron Man event.
