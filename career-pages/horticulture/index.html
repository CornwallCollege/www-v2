alumni-text: I studied garden design from 2002 to 2004 and I loved how the course was so varied; the modules included anything from soil science and genetics, to garden history and design. The tutors were passionate about their subjects and it was a dream to study in Cornwall and discover all the interesting plants that grow in its mild climate. After completing further study I then worked as a nursery assistant at The Beth Chatto Gardens, I was a student gardener at the National Botanic Garden of Wales, a trainee journalist at the Royal Horticultural Society’s The Garden magazine, where I then became Editorial Projects Manager and I am now Deputy Editor of Amateur Gardening magazine. My main role is to create three features a week for the magazine; this involves thinking of ideas, researching, writing features and commissioning other writers, as well as picture research. It's a really interesting and creative role, with demanding weekly deadlines. I love being creative but the best thing about my job is that I'm always learning new things about plants. That's the great thing about horticulture, it's a life-long learning experience.
