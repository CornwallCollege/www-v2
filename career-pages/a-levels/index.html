staff-text: Chris's specialism is Geology, which he studied at university. A love of the subject stemmed from dinosaurs and trips to the Jurassic Coast fossil hunting as a child. Rumour has it he still loves dinosaurs! Chris joined Cornwall College in 2003, since then his Geology programme has gone from strength to strength, with his students scoring some of the best grades on results day. in 2014 he became Head of A-levels for The Cornwall College Group, a year that saw the A-level Centre in St Austell become the top provider in Cornwall

student-text1: I have really enjoyed my time studying English Literature, Psychology, Communication and Culture as well as a Subsidary Diploma in Musical Theatre. The teachers value each student and I have benefited greatly from their support. My highlight has been performing at Winter Lights with my musical theatre class. After A-levels I hope to study a degree that encompasses elements of all the social sciences.

student-text2: My two years at Cornwall College were extremely enjoyable, both socially and academically. Each teacher was passionate about their subject and wanted every student to succeed, this drove me to achieve and ultimately led to me making the choice to move to London and pursue chemistry at Imperial College. My A-levels were the building blocks for my academic success, there is no doubt that without them I wouldn’t be where I am today, at the forefront of chemical research. Adam is part way through a Chemistry Research PhD at Imperial College London.

student-text3: The tutors are wonderful - it's clear that they care about students' individual needs. They have a good balance between respect, fun and discipline, which I think is really important for maintaining a good atmosphere within the college.
