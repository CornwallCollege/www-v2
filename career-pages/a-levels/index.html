student-text1: I have really enjoyed my time studying English Literature, Psychology, Communication and Culture as well as a Subsidary Diploma in Musical Theatre. The teachers value each student and I have benefited greatly from their support. My highlight has been performing at Winter Lights with my musical theatre class. After A-levels I hope to study a degree that encompasses elements of all the social sciences.

student-text2: The high success rates in my chosen subjects of Chemistry, Maths, Physics and Geology made it an easy decision to choose Cornwall College. It's been a brilliant place to study, tutors are fantastic, I have gained numerous skills and developed my subject knowledge immensely. I now have a stable platform to progress on to university and beyond.
