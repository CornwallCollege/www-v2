alumni-text: I wanted to get myself a trade and this was the best place to come, there's a lot of practical work and that makes it              easier to learn. The tutors are good, it's just like having a friend. They're reliable, easy to talk to and if you've              got a problem they're always straight there to sort it out. I'm a land-based engineering apprentice with Vincent                    Tractors and I'm keen to stay there working on getting more experience and one day hopefully go on my own.
