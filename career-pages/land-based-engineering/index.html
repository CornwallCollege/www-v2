alumni-text: I wanted to get myself a trade and this was the best place to come, there's a lot of practical work and that makes it easier to learn. The tutors are good, it's just like having a friend. They're reliable, easy to talk to and if you've              got a problem they're always straight there to sort it out. I'm a land-based engineering apprentice with Vincent                    Tractors and I'm keen to stay there working on getting more experience and one day hopefully go on my own.

student-text1: I did land-based engineering at Level 2 full-time here before I became an apprentice and it helped me to learn a lot before going into work. When I'm here I get to learn and do things for my portfolio that I don't do day-to-day at                  work. I get on with everyone here, it's a really nice working environment.
