staff-text: Luke is a keen surfer and loves the ocean, so after leaving school he travelled the world for ten years before getting             back into education and going to university. After graduating from Plymouth University in 2009 he worked as a research             associate and an environmental consultant, specialising in pollution, particularly air emissions. Luke joined the ocean             sciences team at Falmouth Marine School as a laboratory technician. Over the years he has progressed to become                     programme manager, he also lectures on the degree programme.
