student-text1: Every job is linked with business so it is a key course, and business has a lot of general uses in work. I love the Business Extended Diploma, the tutors are really helpful and always have the time to work with us. I'm also studying an accountancy qualification (AAT) alongsidethe course, that's the career route I want to take when I finish college.
