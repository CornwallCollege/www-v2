        <p class="lead">The Key Information Set (KIS) was introduced by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) in 2012; to enable applicants to compare universities and university courses. It contains some key data such as student satisfaction, money and assessment information.</p>

        <p>Key Information Sets (KIS) provide some essential information our courses but not everything. There is so much more information available about what we can offer you, so let us help you make the right decision about your future.</p>
