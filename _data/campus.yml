      location: Bicton
      detail: Open to the public, students and staff of Bicton College who have young children, Saplings Children’s Centre, situated on campus, provides a safe haven from Monday to Friday 8am - 6pm. The nursery caters for children aged between three months and five years of age and is open to staff, students and members of the public. Saplings Children’s Centre provides excellent facilities and is run by experienced childcare professionals.</br></br>It is the aim of Saplings Children’s Centre to create a setting in which all children are valued and respected, in a secure, healthy and happy environment where children’s rights are upheld and preserved at all times, and where they are encouraged to explore their world and develop skills. Through this they will recognise their own individuality and achievements, whatever their different languages, cultures and special needs.</br></br>Our goal is to provide the children in our care with exciting play experiences, and to offer a high quality curriculum to build on what they already know and broaden their interests and abilities. We shall encourage children to make choices and decisions to help develop them for the future that lies ahead of them in the school system and beyond.  In doing so they shall experience a wide range of approaches and teaching methods to achieve their full potential and goals.</br></br>The value of play is often underestimated, but to a child play is their primary occupation. Our rationale is to provide all the children with opportunities to play, where the child’s participation is freely chosen and intrinsically motivating, i.e. to play for pleasure and not to please others. Above all we wish for children to have fun.</br></br>www.saplingschildrenscentre.com
