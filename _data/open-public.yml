        <p>We do have to make a charge for workshop time, but it is only a fraction of what you would have to pay at a garage (even the smallest ones). We also are able to sell most of our parts at a discount price.</p>
        <p>Another service we offer is to get your car ready for its MOT test and also make the booking for you to take it to a local test station where we know and trust the staff to ensure that you get a fair test, This means that you will never need to worry about things being failed unnecessarily and if something does need to be done, there is usually no charge for the re-test.</p>
