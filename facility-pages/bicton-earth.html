    <p class="facilities">Bicton's Home Farm was purchased in 1947 and over the years it has developed into a thriving educational facility and working farm.</p>
    <p>The farm's core objectives are:
      <ul>
        <li>To provide state-of-the-art resources for education and practical training.</li>
        <li>To generate a financial surplus for re-investment.</li>
        <li>To show efficient methods of production and demonstrate leading practices in land use.</li>
        <li>To provide Devon's agricultural industry with innovative and sustainable pathways for the future.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The College farm is run commercially with the aim of producing above average husbandry results and financial returns. To meet the work experience and academic needs of the students undertaking studies in agriculture, a range of enterprises are exhibited. Students undertake regular periods of work experience and practical instruction on the units, enabling them to gain a wide appreciation of the differing sectors of agriculture.</p>

    <h3>First Rare Breeds Survival Trust College</h3>
    <p>Bicton College is the UK's first Rare Breeds Survival Trust's College.  Rare breeds are a key part of the curriculum, and Home Farm works closely with Bicton's Â£3m Animal Husbandry School in teaching animal care, husbandry and conservation as well as related enterprise activities.</p>
    <p>Devon and Cornwall Longwool ewes and ram are resident on site along with a flock of Dorset Horn sheep.  Berkshire and Oxford Sandy and Black pigs live on the farm as well as rare breed poultry groups (including Cream Legbar Chickens).</p>

    <h3>Physical and Geographic Features on the Farms</h3>
    <p>Bicton Home Farm has a light sandy loam soil which can suffer during dry summers from drought. This limitation means that the majority of the land is categorised as Grade 2/3. The B3178 main Budleigh Salterton road splits Home Farm, isolating the farm buildings and 43 hectares of mostly low lying land adjacent to the River Otter. The listed parkland surrounding Bicton House is also permanent pasture, because of the large number of trees, planted in the last century, and planned conservation management with English Heritage.  These areas are utilised by the sheep flock, dairy youngstock and a small Pedigree North Devon Suckler herd.</p>
    <p>Bicton Home Farm rises to a height of 61 metres above sea level and is in the rain shadow of the Haldon Hills, so limiting rainfall to 750 mm per annum.  The latitude of the South West peninsula, together with the effects of the Gulf Stream and warm South West winds, provides Bicton with a growing season in excess of 200 days allowing early growth in the spring and a reduction in the length of time livestock has to be housed over winter.</p>
