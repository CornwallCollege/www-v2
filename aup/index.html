            <p style="color:white; padding-bottom:0;">Summary<br>
<br>
This policy encompasses all aspects of IT and communications use including, but not limited to, accessing College network resources, internet & email services, software use and voice communications.<br>
<br>
The use of the College computer systems, voice and data network by staff, students and visitors is subject to the conditions set out in this document. This document is intended to provide guidance to all users of their obligations.<br>
<br>
Background & Definitions<br>
<br>
Cornwall College Information Technology Services (CCITS) relates to all IT services for all College campus sites, and outreach provision.<br>
<br>
"JANET" is the name given to the collection of networking services and facilities which support the communication requirements of the UK education and research community.<br>
<br>
The Higher Education Funding Councils for England, Scotland and Wales, the Learning and Skills Council, the Scottish Further Education Funding Council, the National Council for Education and Training for Wales and the Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment are responsible jointly for the provision of JANET. They exercise this responsibility through their Joint Information Systems Committee (the JISC) and any dispute over the interpretation of this Policy will be resolved by the JISC.<br>
<br>
UKERNA (an acronym for the United Kingdom Education and Research Networking Association) is the trading name of the company contracted by the JISC, acting in the name of the Higher Education Funding Council for England, for the provision of the JANET service. This includes the day-to-day management of this Policy.<br>
<br>
This Policy applies in the first instance to any organisation authorised to use JANET (a "User Organisation"). It is the responsibility of User Organisations to ensure that members of their own user communities use JANET services in an acceptable manner and in accordance with current legislation.<br>
<br>
JANET is maintained to support teaching, learning and research. The connection of any organisation to JANET is governed by the JANET Connection Policy maintained by the JISC.<br>
<br>
Acceptable Use<br>
<br>
Students and Staff may use CCITS for all activities relating to education and training within the corporation. Furthermore Staff and Students are permitted to access and communicate with other User Organisations, over public and private networks to which the College has connectivity for academic purposes only. This includes JANET and other Internet Service Provider (ISP) services utilised by the College.<br>
<br>
Unacceptable Use<br>
<br>
CCITS may not be used for any of the following:
Storing or transmitting any material which is; threatening, libellous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, or other material that would violate any law. You agree not to store any information that may infringe upon or violate any third party's intellectual property rights, including, without limitation, copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, moral right, proprietary rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or contain obscenity, pornography, or be otherwise inflammatory, or which contains any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancel bots, or any other computer programming routines that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or obtain any system, data, network or personal information.<br>
<br>
The installation, storage, or use of software other than those applications provided by or authorised for installation by CCITS. This includes licensed, shareware, and freeware software, and extends to software written by authorised users unless it has been produced as part of their course of study or employment with Cornwall College.<br>
<br>
Playing of ANY computer games, including internet games unless directly related to your studies.<br>
<br>
Where CCITS is being used to access another network, any abuse of the acceptable use policy of that network will be regarded as unacceptable use of CCITS.<br>
<br>
Compliance<br>
<br>
It is the responsibility of all staff and students to take reasonable steps to ensure compliance with the conditions set out in this Policy document, and to ensure that unacceptable use of CCITS does not occur.<br>
<br>
Where necessary, service may be withdrawn from the User. This may take one of two forms.<br>
i. An indefinite withdrawal of service, should a violation of these conditions persist after appropriate warnings have been given by CCITS.<br>
ii. A temporary withdrawal of service.<br>
Restoration would be made only when Information Technology Services was satisfied that the appropriate steps had been taken by the User involved to ensure acceptable behaviour in future.<br>
<br>
Access may be suspended should a violation of these conditions cause serious degradation of the service to other users of CCITS. Such a suspension would be made on the judgement of CCITS.<br>
<br>
Where violation of these conditions is illegal or unlawful, or results in loss or damage to CCITS, JANET resources, or the resources of third parties accessible via JANET, the matter may be referred for legal action.<br>
<br>
Upon first violation the incident will be reported to your course manager or head of department. Further violations may result in disciplinary action.<br>
<br>
Identification Cards<br>
<br>
Each member of the organisation will be issued with an identification card. This should be carried at all times while on college campuses.<br>
<br>
The identification cards are used to access printing and library services.<br>
<br>
In the event of an identification card being lost or stolen it must be reported as soon as possible to the nearest local office.<br>
<br>
Replacements for lost or stolen identification cards can be obtained from the local offices.<br>
<br>
Personal Equipment<br>
<br>
The policy for non residential students is that laptops brought onto campuses by the students are the responsibility of the students and will not be tested by the College. When students log on to the network wirelessly a “conditions of use” notice will appear which will include a declaration that they have checked the condition of their power lead.
